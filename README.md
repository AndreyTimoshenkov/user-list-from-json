The app takes a list of users from the locally stored JSON file and renders a table with the data. It is possible to delete each user row. Sorting the data in both ascending and descending fashion is available too. The data will be restored on page reload.

To run:

1. Clone the repository using git clone;
2. run 'npx serve' to run the app locally;
3. Enjoy sorting and deleting the users!
